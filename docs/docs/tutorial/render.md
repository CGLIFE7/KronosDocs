# Render



## Mark as Separate

Mark object to render as a separate layer. If multiple objects are selected, they will be grouped together on a view layer.

## Clear Separate

Before rendering, you can run this to be alerted of any objects hidden in the viewport that will
sneakily show up and and ruin a render. (Nice try Default Cube)

## Render Separate

Render the scene considering the marked objects. Marked objects will be separate view layers based on their assigned groups.
The scene will be cleaned up after, including all collections and view layers. 

## Open in Photoshop

Render the scene, and open the rendered image in photoshop automatically after.

## Render without GUI

Render a still or animation without blender being open. A notification will be send on the computer when the render is finished. The file Output can be changed in the addon preferences.
