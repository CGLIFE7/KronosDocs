# Interface and Menus



## Main Menu

The Kronos main menu is mapped to 'W' by default. 
This can be changed in the preferences, and there is a button to override the default 'W' bind, toggle selection mode.

The important thing is that the main menu key is a button that one of your fingers naturally rests on. This minimizes the need to move your fingers when using kronos
resulting in speed like never before.

## Menu Tutorial


Hold down 'W' (main menu key) to start.

From here, you have three options.



1 Release W(tapping W gives the same result). This pops up the main menu.

2 Move your mouse(While holding W still). This pops up the main pie menu.

>- With some practise you can press W, fling your mouse in the direction of the tool you want and release w very quickly. See the gif.


3 Press any hotkey from the text menu on the left to trigger the matching tool.

>- By default these keys are :

    *D

    *A

    *SPACE

    *SHIFT

    *RIGHTMOUSE

    *LEFTMOUSE

    *MIDDLEMOUSE

>- In similar fashion to the pie menu, you can very quickly press w and another key and release immediately after.
