# Interface and Menus

## Main Menu

The Kronos main menu is mapped to 'W' by default. 
This can be changed in the preferences, and there is a button to override the default 'W' bind, toggle selection mode.

The important thing is that the main menu key is a button that one of your fingers naturally rests on. This minimizes the need to move your fingers when using kronos
resulting in speed like never before.

## Menu Tutorial

Hold down 'W' (main menu key) to start.

From here, you have three options.

1. Release W (tapping W gives the same result). This pops up the main menu.

&NewLine;
2. Move your mouse (While holding W still). This pops up the main pie menu.
   > - With some practice you can press W, fling your mouse in the direction of the tool you want and release W very quickly. See the gif.
&NewLine;  
&NewLine;
3. Press any hotkey from the text menu on the left to trigger the matching tool.
   > - For example, pressing W + Space by default triggers image search.
&NewLine;  
&NewLine;
   > - In similar fashion to the pie menu, you can very quickly press W and another key and release immediately after.
