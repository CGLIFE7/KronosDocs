# Interface and Menus

## Main Menu

The Kronos main menu key is 'W' by default. 
This can be changed in the preferences, and there is a button to override the default 'W' bind, toggle selection mode.

The important thing is the main menu key is a button one of your fingers naturally sits on. This minimizes the need to move your fingers,
resulting in speed like never before.

## Menu Tutorial

Hold down 'W' (main menu key) to start.

From here, three options.

1. Release W (tapping W gives the same result). This pops up the main menu.

2. Move your mouse (While holding W still). This pops up the main pie menu.
   > - With practice you can press W, fling your mouse in the direction of the tool you want and release W very quickly.
&NewLine;  
&NewLine;
3. Press any hotkey from the text menu on the left to trigger the matching tool.
   > - For example, pressing W + Space by default triggers image search.
&NewLine;  
&NewLine;
   > - Like the pie menu, you can very quickly press W and another key and release immediately after.
