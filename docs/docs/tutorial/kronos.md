# What Is KRONOS?

Have you ever been using blender, done something tedious and thought, 'why is there no tool for this'?

KRONOS is a toolkit focused on more time designing, less time clicking buttons.

Most KRONOS tools are for general blender operations that many users will encounter, with the odd niche tool scattered along the way.

## INSTALL

Install Kronos in 3 easy steps:

- 1   Open Blender as an administrator. Download and install kronos.zip using the 'install' button in Blender preferences (EDIT > PREFERENCES > ADDONS).

- 2    Enable Kronos in the addon settings. In the Kronos settings, go to 'Setup' and press 'Install Dependencies'.

- 3    Restart Blender after seeing the 'Dependencies installed successfully' notice.

You're all set!
