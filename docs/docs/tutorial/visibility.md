## Find Hidden

Find Hidden allows you to very easy unhide a hidden object without searching through the outliner.

## Catch Sly Objects

Before rendering, you can run this to be alerted of any objects hidden in the viewport that will
sneakily show up and and ruin a render. (Nice try Default Cube)

## Shroud

Just a cool placeholder.
