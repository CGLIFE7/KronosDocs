Hold 'W' to start

Then either:

1. Release for main menu
&NewLine;  
&NewLine;
&NewLine;  
&NewLine;
2. Move your mouse (keep W held) for pie menu
&NewLine;  
&NewLine;
   > - With practice you can press W, fling your mouse in a tools direction and release W quickly. Make sure W is fully held down before beginning to move the mouse.
&NewLine;  
&NewLine;
3. Press a hotkey from the text menu to trigger the corrosponding tool
&NewLine;  
&NewLine;
   > - Pressing W + Space by default triggers image search
&NewLine;  
&NewLine;
   > - Like the pie, you can quickly press W + another key and release immediately

Simply tap W for the edit mode menu, nothing fancy there.
