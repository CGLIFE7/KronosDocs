# Setup

![Alt Text](images/hotkey.png){: style="height:50%;width:50%"}

Select a new hotkey for the main menu, or click 'override' to swap the default 'W' swap selection tool for kronos menu.

Ensure the menu is a key one of your fingers rests on. This prevents moving your fingers,
resulting in speed like never before.

## How To

![Alt Text](gifs/MenuGuide2.gif)

Hold 'W'/Menu key to start.

From here, 3 options.

1. Release for main menu
&NewLine;  
&NewLine;
&NewLine;  
&NewLine;
2. Move your mouse (keep menu key held) for pie menu
&NewLine;  
&NewLine;
   > - With practice you can press W, fling your mouse in a tools direction and release W quickly
&NewLine;  
&NewLine;
3. Press a hotkey from the text menu to trigger the corrosponding tool
&NewLine;  
&NewLine;
   > - Pressing W + Space by default triggers image search
&NewLine;  
&NewLine;
   > - Like the pie, you can quickly press W + another key and release immediately
