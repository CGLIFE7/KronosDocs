Interactive HDRI tool. Auto setup a hdri world, swap between hdris, and adjust them with ease.

The tool uses 3 worlds, basic, sun/hdri mix and two suns.

Requires a folder of hdris to be selected in the preferences. Said folder can contain other files, however since jpg is supported non hdri images will also be swapped through.
