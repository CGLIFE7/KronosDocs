Interactive HDRI tool. Make sure you select an hdri in preferences to use.

The tool uses 3 worlds, basic, sun/hdri mix and two suns.

Shift click on the button for sun/hdri, ctrl click for two suns.

From then on normal clicks always adjusts current world. Use shift, ctrl to swap to other worlds or alt for basic.

Requires a folder of hdris to be selected in the preferences. Said folder can contain other files, however since jpg is supported non hdri images will also be swapped through.
