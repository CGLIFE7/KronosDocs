Mark objects to render seperately in their own view layer. Several objects can be marked at once to go in a grouped layer.

Objects will render as if all together in terms of lighting however will just be split in the final render. Great for seperating objects to be easily edited in something like Photoshop.

Use the render separate button and blender will render out seperate layers based on marked objects.

Use the clear separate button to remove separate objs.

Not yet supported for eevee.
