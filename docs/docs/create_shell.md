This tool lets you create shell/plating pieces from other objects using support geometry without cleanup being required.


Activate the tool, then create whatever loopcuts/insets/knife tool cuts you like, select the faces you want to make a shell from, and confirm.

The faces you selected will now be their own seperate object, and the original mesh will be untouched(loop cuts etc reverted)
