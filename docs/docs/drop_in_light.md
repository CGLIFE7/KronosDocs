Spawns a light halfway between the camera position and world origin.

Position the camera first looking at where you want the light to be angled. 

Adjust size with mouse and scroll to change position, shift + scroll to change brightness.

In the hourglass dropdown menu you can enable 'finish on release' to keep the shortcut buttons you used to activate the tool held, then adjust and release them to end immediately.
